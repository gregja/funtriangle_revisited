# funtriangle_revisited
the funtriangle project revisited in full canvas

I discovered recently the program "Fun triangle" written by Lea Rosema. I like a lot this Javascript program which generates SVG graphics.

Because it's interesting to do, I rewrote it with the goal to replace the SVG by a "full canvas" version.

The project contains different versions :

- v0 : very closed to the original version of Lea Rosema, with some modifications, like "use strict" mode, and IIFE module

- v1 : intermediate version combining SVG and Canvas graphics, not working completely (I added a "save picture" button)

- v2 : intermediate version (works fine), with Canvas for the main graph, and red balls in SVG for "dragging" mode

- v3 : final version "full canvas" (no SVG)
